"There is nothing more gratifying to me than to see a woman fall in love with herself. She is better for herself, her family and... the world." - DeAnne Grasinger

We are Brian and Lindsay Schlick.

International husband and wife photography and video team, specializing in pampering glamour/fashion/boudoir/beauty sessions for all women.  
We are here to provide every lady with a luxury pampering supermodel experience. A photo/video session with us is NO 20min strip-mall portrait session. No Ma'am!

We are the real deal!  
Our 'SchlickArt Signature Pampering Photo Sessions' consists of a full hair and makeover, a gift box of goodies, champagne and chocolates, your favorite music while you are being pampered, 4 wardrobe changes and a chance to portray the story of who you really are:

Your sexy beautiful self, inside and out!  
We are all about getting to know our clients and becoming good friends with them. We are here to make you look and feel amazing, create you some stunning imagery that would make any ex-boyfriend jealous and your partner eager to dine and romance you with a night on the town after the shoot.  
This pampering photo/video session sounds like something right up your alley doesn't it!

We look forward to meeting you!
